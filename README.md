## About ðŸš€
This repository is designed to host the backend system to an Aerospace Corporation project. The project relays on GPS satellite tracking data to identify and analyze deadzones around the world. Its application is vast where it can be crucial in navigations, tracking and visualizing deadzones.

**Key Components**
1. **Database: InfluxDB v1**
   + **Type** : Time Series Database
   + **Purpose** : InfluxDB allows storage of time series data. In addition Influx handles high write and query loads                     typical of time series data.
   + **Benefits**:
       - **Flexibility** Influx is built to be flexible allowing for various data structures and data types.
       - **Durability** Inlfux is robust, easily handles high write and query loads which are critical to data preservation.


The project as a whole leverages Influx DB vast capabilities to provide neccessary performance to time sensitive data. It maintains the integrity of the data while also allowing the system to adapt to changing requirements.
